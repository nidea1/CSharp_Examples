## Voting Application

When the application is launched, pre-defined categories should be listed for voting. Only users registered in the system can cast votes. During voting, the user's username should be requested first. If not registered in the system, they should be given the opportunity to register and be able to continue voting from where they left off. Categories can be determined optionally.

**Some Example Categories**

- Movie Categories
- Tech Stack Categories
- Sports Categories

Finally, when the application is terminated, the voting results should be displayed both numerically and as a percentage.

**Techniques to be used**

- Categories can be used as pre-defined.

## ATM Application

Upon launching the application, the user should be prompted to choose the operation they would like to perform. These operations consist of basic ATM functionalities such as withdrawing money, depositing money, making payments, etc. These operations can be expanded according to needs. Initially, it should be ensured that the user accessing the ATM is a registered user in the system.

The application should also include an 'End of Day' option. When this option is selected, logs of all transactions made during the day and potential fraud attempts (such as incorrect login attempts) should be displayed. The logs should be written to a file named EOD_Date(in DDMMYYYY format).txt located at a specified location on the client's computer.


**Techniques to be used**

- Writing to a file
- Reading from a file
- The list of operations can be pre-defined.

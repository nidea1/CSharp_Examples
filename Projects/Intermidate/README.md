# Intermidate C# Projects from Patika.DEV

## Area Calculation

Create a C# console application that meets the following requirements:

- The desired geometric shape for the operation should be taken from the user (Circle, Triangle, Square, Rectangle, etc.)
- Depending on the selected shape, edge information should be obtained from the user.
- The desired dimension to be calculated should be obtained from the user (Perimeter, Area, Volume, etc.)
- The calculation result should be returned in an understandable manner

**Points to Consider**
- Code repetition should be avoided
- The application should be divided into classes and methods in accordance with the Single Responsibility rule.

## Sum of Integers

Write a console application that takes pairs of integers n from the screen, calculates their sum, and prints the sum if the numbers are different; if the numbers are the same, it prints the square of their sum.

- Input: 2 3 1 5 2 5 3 3

- Output: 5 6 7 81

## Absolute Square

Write a console application that checks if each of the n numbers entered from the screen is smaller or larger than 67. For numbers smaller than 67, calculate the total of their differences from 67. For numbers larger than 67, calculate the total of the squared absolute differences from 67. Print both results to the screen.

- Input: 56 45 68 77

- Output: 33 101

## Reverse Char

Write a console application that swaps the first and last characters of a given string and then prints it to the screen.

- Input: Merhaba Hello Algoritma x

- Output: aerhabM oellH algoritmA x

## Consonants

Write a console application that checks a given string for two consecutive consonants. If the string has two adjacent consonants, it should print true, otherwise, it should print false.

- Input: Merhaba Umut Arya

- Output: True False True
